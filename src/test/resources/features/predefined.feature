    Then I should see page title as "Google"
    Then element with xpath "//input[@name='q']" should be present
    When I type "Behavior Driven Development" into element with xpath "//input[@name='q']"
    Then I click on element using JavaScript with xpath "(//input[@name='btnK'])[1]"
    Then I wait for element with xpath "//*[@id='res']" to be present
